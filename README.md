# Find My Book
My Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree’s capstone app.
## Introduction
Find My Book is developed to help booklovers locate the nearest library that a book is available by enabling a user to scan a book’s ISBN number and retrieve its information from the national library’s database.

This app is currently available for users in Singapore only as it accesses the Open Web Service REST API of the Singapore’s National Library Board at this time. Future versions will auto select API sources based on the user’s country location.
## Intended User
Book­loving library members.
## Features
- Scans ISBN barcode
- Queries library for book information
